# WinForm_ParkingLot_AttendantSystem

# Project Concept

  A wealthy business plans on building a new state of the art parking lot system.
  The system will provide a simple interface to Add new customers and generate a parking lot number.
  The attendant will input the customer's names, and be able to print/write out a ticket stub for the customer.
  The attendant will remove existing customers, and their old space will be free for use again.
  There is no requirement for saving records, or utilizing a DataBase at this time.
  
  # Software Design
  
   The system will maintain an array of parking spaces that tracks which parking spaces are open.
   The customer will provide their name, and attendant can enter the license plate number.
   The system allows for searching of customer's cars or lookup by name
   The system allows for quick removal of customers by either one of the three fields
   The system will provide feedback if more than one customer meets removal criteria, allowing attendant to correct input.
   A Login feature was added, without passwords for testing and free use at this time.
